# Optimization and Trading Strategy Visualization

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various optimization techniques and their applications in deep learning and trading strategies. The scripts are built using `Streamlit`, `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow`, and other libraries to provide interactive visualizations and comparisons of different optimizers.

## Files Overview

### 1. **`methods.py`**
- **Purpose**: Visualizes the behavior of different optimizers (SGD, Momentum, RMSprop, Adam, Adagrad, Nadam) on a sample quadratic loss function.
- **Features**:
  - Interactive selection of optimizers and hyperparameters.
  - 2D and 3D plots of the loss surface and optimizer trajectories.
  - Explanation of how each optimizer works.

### 2. **`opt2.py`**
- **Purpose**: Compares first-order optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSprop) with second-order optimizers (LBFGS) on a simple neural network trained on the MNIST dataset.
- **Features**:
  - Interactive selection of optimizers and hyperparameters.
  - Training and comparison of loss curves for first-order and second-order optimizers.
  - Visualization of training progress.

### 3. **`optimization.py`**
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates and compares the performance of different optimizers (Gradient Descent, Momentum, RMSprop, Adam) on a simple quadratic loss function.
- **Features**:
  - Interactive selection of hyperparameters for each optimizer.
  - Visualization of the loss function and optimizer trajectories.
  - Mathematical equations for each optimizer.

### 4. **`tfexam.py`**
- **Purpose**: Tunes and trains a simple neural network on the MNIST dataset using different optimizers (SGD, Momentum, RMSprop, Adam, Adagrad, Nadam).
- **Features**:
  - Interactive selection of optimizers and hyperparameters.
  - Training progress visualization with loss and accuracy plots.
  - Final training and validation accuracy display.

### 5. **`trading.py`**
- **Purpose**: Optimizes a trading strategy (moving average crossover) using different optimizers (SGD, Momentum, RMSprop, Adam, Adagrad, Nadam) on stock data.
- **Features**:
  - Interactive selection of optimizers and hyperparameters.
  - Visualization of stock data and strategy performance.
  - Optimization of strategy parameters and comparison of cumulative returns.

## Requirements

To run these scripts, you need the following Python libraries:

- `streamlit`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `torch`
- `tensorflow`
- `yfinance` (for `trading.py`)
- `scikit-learn` (for `opt2.py`)

You can install the required libraries using:
