# Bias-Variance Tradeoff Demo

This repository contains a series of interactive demos that illustrate the **Bias-Variance Tradeoff** in machine learning models. The demos are built using **Streamlit** and cover different types of models, including **Polynomial Regression** and **Transformers**. The goal is to help users understand how model complexity affects bias, variance, and overall prediction error.

## Files Overview

### 1. `base.py`
- **Description**: This file demonstrates the bias-variance tradeoff using a **Polynomial Regression** model. It allows users to adjust the polynomial degree and visualize how the model fits the data, along with the corresponding bias, variance, and total error.
- **Key Features**:
  - Interactive slider to adjust the polynomial degree.
  - Visualization of the model fit, true function, and noisy data.
  - Bias, variance, and total error breakdown.
  - Bias-variance tradeoff curve for different polynomial degrees.

### 2. `base1.py`
- **Description**: An enhanced version of `base.py` with a more user-friendly interface and additional explanations. It also includes a **Bias-Variance Tradeoff Curve** and provides feedback on the model's complexity.
- **Key Features**:
  - Improved UI with a wide layout and better visualizations.
  - Feedback on model complexity (low, balanced, high).
  - Detailed explanation of the bias-variance tradeoff.
  - Interactive slider for polynomial degree selection.

### 3. `base3.py`
- **Description**: This file extends the concept of bias-variance tradeoff to **Transformer models**. It allows users to adjust the number of attention heads, transformer layers, and hidden layer size to see how these parameters affect the model's performance.
- **Key Features**:
  - Interactive sliders for adjusting transformer parameters (number of heads, layers, and hidden dimension).
  - Visualization of the transformer model fit compared to the true function and noisy data.
  - Bias, variance, and total error breakdown.
  - Bias-variance tradeoff curve for different transformer layers.
  - Explanation of how bias-variance tradeoff applies to transformers.

## How to Run the Demos

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the required Python packages installed. You can install them using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit numpy matplotlib scikit-learn torch
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit App**:
   To run any of the demos, navigate to the directory containing the file and use the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run base.py
   ```
   Replace `base.py` with `base1.py` or `base3.py` to run the other demos.

3. **Interact with the Demo**:
   - Adjust the sliders in the sidebar to change model parameters.
   - Observe how the model fit, bias, variance, and total error change with different settings.
   - Explore the bias-variance tradeoff curve to understand the relationship between model complexity and error.

## Key Concepts

### Bias-Variance Tradeoff
- **Bias**: Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm. High bias can cause an algorithm to miss relevant relations between features and target outputs (underfitting).
- **Variance**: Error due to the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. High variance can cause overfitting, where the model captures noise instead of the underlying pattern.
- **Total Error**: The sum of bias and variance. The goal is to find a model complexity that minimizes the total error.

### Model Complexity
- **Low Complexity**: Models with low complexity (e.g., low polynomial degree or few transformer layers) tend to have high bias and low variance, leading to underfitting.
- **High Complexity**: Models with high complexity (e.g., high polynomial degree or many transformer layers) tend to have low bias and high variance, leading to overfitting.
- **Optimal Complexity**: The ideal model complexity balances bias and variance to minimize the total error.
